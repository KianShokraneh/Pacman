# Pac-Man AI

## Overview
This project is an implementation of AI algorithms to enhance the gameplay of Pac-Man. Developed as part of UC Berkeley's CS 188 Pac-Man AI Projects, this repository explores various search algorithms and adversarial techniques to optimize Pac-Man's navigation and decision-making within a dynamic environment.

## Features
- **Search Algorithms**: Implementation of A* (A-star), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the optimal paths for Pac-Man to reach its goals.
- **Adversarial Search**: Integration of Expectimax and Minimax algorithms to develop intelligent adversarial agents that challenge Pac-Man.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Application of reinforcement learning techniques to enable Pac-Man to adapt and improve its strategies over time based on previous experiences.
